 🚗 Car Sales Data Cleaning and Analysis

This project focuses on **data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using Microsoft Excel. The dataset contains car sales information, and it goes through multiple steps to ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness for further analysis or visualization.

 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Car_Name`
- `Year`
- `Selling_Price`
- `Present_Price`
- `Kms_Driven`
- `Fuel_Type`
- `Seller_Type`
- `Transmission`
- `Owner`

🛠️ Tasks Performed

✅ Data Cleaning
- Remove Duplicates: Ensured uniqueness of records.
- Handle Missing Values: Filled or highlighted NULL/blank entries using formulas or logical assumptions.
- Standardize Text: Used functions like `TRIM()`, `PROPER()`, and `LOWER()` to fix inconsistent formatting.
- Split Columns: Separated brand and model names where applicable.
- Correct Data Types: Converted columns to the appropriate formats (e.g., numbers, dates, currency).


🔄 Data Transformation
- Created Derived Columns: Added columns like `Car_Age = Current Year - Year`.
- Used Conditional Formatting: Highlighted outliers in `Selling_Price` or `Mileage`.
- Applied Data Validation: Restricted input values for `Fuel_Type`, `Transmission`, etc., to dropdown lists.
- Filtered & Sorted Data: For easy insights and dashboard preparation.



 🔍 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Functions, Pivot Tables, Charts, Power Query)
- Git & GitHub for version control
